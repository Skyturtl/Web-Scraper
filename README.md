# Web-Scraper
For HKUST class COMP4321 GP15 <br> <strong>By: William Chen, Po Wa Ho</strong>, Fung Ming Sze
## Overview:
This project implements a web crawler and search engine for indexing and querying web pages. The system includes a crawler, an inverted index, a TF-IDF-based ranking mechanism, and a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.



## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries(Flask, textblob, requests, beautifulsoup4, nltk, sqlite3, aiohttp)
- Internet connection (for downloading NLTK tokenizer)
- Stopwords File

## Project Structure: 
- main.py
- scraper.py
- database.py
- stopwords.txt
- scraper.db
- spider_result.py
- spider_result.txt
- Flask.py
- templates/index.html
- recheck.py (optional)

## Design Choices:
- The database schema and design is explained in the document `COMP4321Report.docx`.
- Priority-Based Crawling: Uses a priority queue and BFS to determine the order of crawling.
- Tokenization and Stemming:Removes unnecessary symbols to improve database performance and Retains numbers for meaningful context (e.g., years).
- Inverted Index:Stores word positions in both body and title for efficient phrase matching.
- Boosting Mechanisms: Title match boost applied during ranking to prioritize relevant results.
- Optimized Database Schema: Separate tables for links, keywords, positions, and relationships.

## How to run:
To build and execute the web crawler, start by setting up the database. 
1. Download all the necessary libraries as listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
   1. Can be done using **`pip install <library_name>`**
   2. **`pip install flask textblob requests beautifulsoup4 nltk sqlite3 aiohttp`**
2. Ensure **`stopwords.txt`** is in the project directory and delete that **`scraper.db`** and **`spider_result.txt`** if you want a fresh run. 
3. Run the command **`python main.py`** to initialize the database and start the web crawler. 
   1. This command will create the necessary tables in the SQLite database, begin crawling from the specified seed URL (defined in `main.py`), and store the extracted data, including links, keywords, and parent-child relationships, in `scraper.db`.
5. Run **`python spider_result.py`**
   1. After we have indexed all the necessary pages and generated a corresponding database, we need to generate the spider result. This command will fetch the indexed data from the database and create a formatted `spider_result.txt` file that contains the pages, keywords, and child links.
6.Run **`Flask.py`**
   1.Start the Flask web server:Open the search engine in your browser at **`http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html`**.

## Usage:
1.Search Queries
2.Search Features
3.Query History
4.Bookmarks

## Specifications:
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Framework: Flask
Database: SQLite
Libraries: BeautifulSoup, TextBlob, NLTK, aiohttp

May need to use `py -m pip install <library>` and `py <file_name.py>` instead of `python` because of PATH issues.
